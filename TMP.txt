# IMPORTANT !!!
# The following part just tests the A* algorithm
# The latter is ran once as we suppose nothing moves (collisions for instance) while the player is moving
# Thus it is assumed that the source is static during the search
#if not search:
#    dest[0] = randint(0, board.size - 1)
#    dest[1] = randint(0, board.size - 1)

#    src[0] = randint(0, board.size - 1)
#    src[1] = randint(0, board.size - 1)

#    board.clear_grid()
#    board.clear_goal()

#    path = astar.astar(board, src, dest)

#    search = True
#else:
    #if not path:
    #    search = False
    #else:
    #    pos = path.pop()
    #    board.set_cell_value(pos[0], pos[1], 1)
